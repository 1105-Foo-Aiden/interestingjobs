            <p>Being Self Employed opens up the possiblilities like working my own hours and being able to work from home perfectly fine. There's the cons of it being extremely difficult to get off the ground but once you get past the point, there's many good things to come</p>
            <p>The new skills I would learn is definitely managing people and learning people skills.</p>
            <p>Really the only goals I would want is just to make a living and just being sucessful</p>
            <p>I definitely have the qualifications to start the buisiness but I would still need to know everything about running a business which would be difficult but not impossible, many have done it before</p>
